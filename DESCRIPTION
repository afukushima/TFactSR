Description: TFactS is to predict which are the transcription factors (TFs), regulated in 
    a biological condition based on lists of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) obtained
    from transcriptome experiments. This package is based on the TFactS concept and expands it.
    It allows users to performe TFactS-like enrichment approach. The package can import
    and use the original catalogue file from the TFactS website (http://www.tfacts.org/) as well as 
    users' defined catalogues of interest that are not supported by TFactS (e.g., Arabidopsis).
